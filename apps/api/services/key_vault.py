"""Encryption envelope for the AI API keys stored per account.

The first version of this derived the Fernet key straight from SESSION_SECRET.
That tied two unrelated lifetimes together: SESSION_SECRET signs session tokens
and should be rotatable at any sign of trouble, while the key that encrypts a
stored API key can never change without making every stored key unreadable.
Rotating one meant destroying the other.

So the two are separated here, and the ciphertext carries a version prefix:

    v2:<fernet token>   encrypted with AI_ENCRYPTION_KEY (or a previous one)
    <fernet token>      legacy, encrypted with the SESSION_SECRET-derived key

Old rows keep decrypting untouched; anything written from now on is v2. Set
AI_ENCRYPTION_KEYS_OLD (comma-separated) while rotating: the new key encrypts,
every listed key still decrypts, and `reencrypt_if_stale` upgrades a row the
next time it is read.

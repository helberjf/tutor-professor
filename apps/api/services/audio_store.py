"""Shared storage for synthesised speech.

The local cache is a directory, which is exactly right for a server that owns its
disk and useless for anything that does not: a file written by one instance is a
404 on the next, and on a read-only bundle it cannot be written at all. With
Kokoro reached over a tunnel to somebody's laptop, losing the cache is not a
small cost — re-reading a book page would re-synthesise every sentence, every
time, over that tunnel.

So an optional second backend: a private Supabase Storage bucket, addressed by
the same md5 the local cache already uses. Same key means an object written by
one instance is a hit for every other, and a redeploy does not lose the cache.

This is deliberately an *additional* branch. With the environment unset,
`build_audio_store()` returns None and every caller falls back to the local
directory, which is what keeps local development, the container path and the
signed-URL tests behaving exactly as before.

Only the REST API is used — no new dependency, just `requests`, which is already
here for the AI providers.

"""Fail when the app uses a light-theme utility class that dark mode does not remap.

Dark mode is implemented in globals.css by overriding a fixed list of Tailwind
classes. That list is easy to fall behind: using a shade nobody listed yet leaves
near-black text on the dark card, and nothing warns you — it just looks broken.
That is how `text-slate-950` shipped unreadable.

This test enumerates the classes the app actually uses and asserts each one is
covered by a `html[data-theme='dark']` rule.

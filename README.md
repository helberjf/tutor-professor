# Tutor and Professor

Tutor and Professor is a full-stack personal tutoring app for anyone who wants to study — a language, a school subject, or programming. It combines short lessons, quizzes, spaced repetition, AI-generated practice, text-to-speech, account controls, and study tools. Content is written for the age band on the profile, from a six-year-old to an adult, which is also what keeps the extra content rules in place when the learner is a minor.

The project was built as a practical engineering exercise: a real product surface, a typed frontend, a Python API, persistent data, AI integration, runtime backend routing, auth, tests, and deployment constraints.

## Live Demo

- Frontend: https://tutorprofessor.vercel.app
- Backend model: the Next.js frontend and the FastAPI API both run on Vercel; the database is PostgreSQL on Supabase. Only the Kokoro voice service may still run on a local machine behind a tunnel, and the app falls back to browser speech when it is off. See `docs/deploy-vercel-supabase.md`.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Full-stack product thinking: learner-facing lessons plus account and admin workflows.
- Typed React/Next.js frontend with reusable API client and runtime connection handling.
- FastAPI backend with SQLModel models, Pydantic schemas, auth, and domain services.
- AI workflows with validation, retry-safe behavior, and safeguards against malformed generated content.
- Spaced repetition and review flows for vocabulary, lesson questions, coding flashcards, and study topics.
- Local-first deployment using Vercel plus Cloudflare Tunnel, including recovery from stale tunnel URLs.
- Automated tests for backend services, AI output validation, UI state helpers, and deployment edge cases.

## Core Features

### Studying

- **One study queue.** "Iniciar estudos" builds a session — today's lesson first,
  then what review is due, then the questions still owed — and drops straight
  into the first card. The queue is stored, so **"Continuar de onde parou"** on
  the home screen resumes the exact card you stopped at, after a reload, a
  closed app, or a day later. `GET /api/study/session` only reads: opening the
  app never starts a session by itself.
- **Nothing already mastered comes back.** A question answered right twice, with
  the last answer also right, retires. The same rule runs on both sides
  (`services/study_queue_service.py` and `lib/question-queue.ts`), and "Refazer
  todas" is there for whoever wants the whole topic again.
- **A guided first run.** `/onboarding` asks who is studying and which language,
  then places the student with a five-question test instead of starting everyone
  at level 1. The test needs no content and no AI, so it works in the account's
  first minute.
- **The day closes by studying.** Finishing a session (or any logged activity)
  marks the day as studied; writing a note about it stays optional.
- **The audience is whoever is studying.** The profile carries an age band
  (4-6 through 18+) and every generator reads it from `services/audience.py`, so
  an adult gets adult examples and a child still gets the content rules a child
  needs. Nothing in the product assumes one or the other.
- Daily lessons with target-language vocabulary, examples, and mini activities.
- Quizzes with scoring and friendly feedback.
- Mixed review sessions combining vocabulary and lesson-generated questions.
- Audio playback through a local TTS provider with browser speech fallback.
- Progress tracking, streaks, level analysis, and daily activity logs.

### Content That Works Without AI

- A curated English pack of **30 lessons × 8 phrases** (levels 1–4, A1 to A2),
  each phrase with a translation, an example sentence, and a word-by-word
  breakdown. The source of truth is `scripts/english_core_pack_data.py`; run
  `python scripts/build_english_core_pack.py` to regenerate the seed files and
  `python scripts/init_db.py` to load them.
- Review questions and four-option practice questions are **derived from the
  lesson itself** (`services/offline_question_service.py`) — deterministic, free,
  and immediate. `POST /api/study/questions/ensure` fills an empty topic, and the
  questions panel calls it before it would show an empty state.
- `POST /api/study/questions/prefetch` tops a topic up **after** the response has
  already been sent: free questions first, and a provider call only when a key
  and credit are actually there. Nobody waits on a spinner for a question.

### Account Area

- Account registration and login. `SIGNUP_MODE=manual` (the default) holds a new account in the administrator's queue; `SIGNUP_MODE=open` lets a verified e-mail address in on its own.
- E-mail verification, forgotten-password reset, password change and sign-out-everywhere, all self-service. Both e-mail flows answer identically for an address that exists and one that does not, so they cannot be used to find out who has an account.
- Optional modules per account: the programming curriculum, flashcard decks and LeetCode trainer ship switched off and are turned on in the account area. The gate is one middleware over route families rather than a check repeated in thirty endpoints.
- Data rights without asking anybody: `GET /api/account/export` downloads everything stored about the account, `POST /api/account/delete` erases it.
- Password policy enforced on both sides: the signup form shows a live strength meter and requirement checklist, and `services/password_policy.py` applies the same rules on the API, so a direct HTTP call cannot skip them.
- Login has a brute-force brake: after `MAX_FAILED_LOGINS` wrong passwords the account is locked for `LOGIN_LOCK_MINUTES` and answers 429 with `Retry-After`. The lock clears itself, and a successful login resets the counter.
- Passwords are stored as PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 600,000 iterations (OWASP's current floor) and a per-password random salt. The hash records its own iteration count, and an older 260,000-iteration hash is upgraded in place on the next successful login.
- Account dashboard for students, progress, settings, and AI provider configuration.
- Student profile management, including target language, age band and audio preferences.
- AI-powered lesson, question, book, and flashcard generation.

### Admin Area

- Admin dashboard at `/admin` with counters for the approval queue, approved accounts, recent signups, and AI authorizations.
- Account approval at `/admin/accounts`: every signup waits in a queue and only reaches the app once approved. Rejecting an account drops its open sessions immediately, and a rejection can be reversed later.
- AI access is a second, independent switch: approving an account grants no AI, and revoking AI leaves the account working. Both are set from the same queue card.
- AI credits meter the administrator's own key at one credit per successful generation. A call the provider never answered is free, and an account using its own API key is never metered. Accounts can be topped up, zeroed, or marked unlimited.
- Per-account AI authorization at `/admin/users`, plus the internal learning content editor at `/admin/learn`.

### Plans and Billing

- Plans live in `apps/api/services/billing_service.py` rather than in a table: a price changes through a reviewable deploy, not a row edited in production. An account with no subscription row is on the free plan, so signup creates nothing and the app runs with billing switched off.
- One `Entitlement` decides everything: how many students a plan allows, and how much AI it includes. The AI allowance is credited into the balance the administrator already controlled, so there is one meter instead of two competing ones, and hand-granted credits are never taken away.
- A 14-day trial needs no payment gateway at all. Paying does, and says so plainly rather than pretending to have taken the money.
- `past_due` keeps working: a card that failed this morning should not take a student's lesson away before the gateway has finished retrying.
- `POST /api/billing/webhook` verifies an HMAC signature over the raw body and ignores repeated deliveries by event id — the retry every gateway sends must not extend a period twice.
- Every generation writes a usage line with an estimated cost in millionths of a currency unit, so "what did this account cost this month" has an answer. See `docs/saas-operacao.md`.

### Installable App (PWA)

- Installable on phone, tablet and desktop: web app manifest, maskable icons, and an `apple-touch-icon` so iPhone and iPad get the real icon instead of a page thumbnail.
- Opens without browser chrome (`display: standalone`), with both the standardised and the legacy `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` meta so iOS before 17 also goes full screen.
- A small service worker caches the app shell and immutable `/_next/static/` assets, and shows `public/offline.html` when a navigation fails with no network. It never touches the backend or any `/api/` route, so the runtime backend URL is always read fresh.
- Icons are generated from the app's own brand mark: `python scripts/generate-pwa-icons.py`.

**Installing it**

- iPhone / iPad: open the site in Safari (it must be Safari), tap Share, then "Adicionar a Tela de Início".
- Android / Chrome: the browser offers "Instalar app", or use the menu's "Adicionar à tela inicial".
- Desktop Chrome / Edge: the install icon appears at the right of the address bar.

Installation needs HTTPS, which the Vercel deployment already provides.

### Study Modes

- General study dashboard with planning, notes, distractions, and pomodoro count.
- Diverse subject study mode for custom topics and AI-generated questions.
- Programming curriculum with subjects, topics, generated explanations, quizzes, and flashcards.
- Coding review and deck-style flashcard study with scheduling state.
- LeetCode-style method trainer.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend | FastAPI, SQLModel, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy |
| Database | PostgreSQL: Supabase in production, local on port 5433 for development |
| Migrations | Alembic through `database_bootstrap.py`, which also keeps Supabase's public Data API locked out of the tables |
| AI | Configurable provider layer, Gemini as the default path |
| TTS | Kokoro-compatible service plus browser fallback; audio cached in a private Supabase Storage bucket |
| Deployment | Vercel for web and API (`pdx1`, next to the database), Docker/VPS path kept in `docs/DEPLOY-VPS.md` |
| Tests | Python unittest-style scripts, Node assertion scripts, TypeScript check |

## Architecture

```text
Browser (PWA)
  |
  | Next.js app on Vercel
  v
FastAPI API on Vercel (serverless, pdx1)
  |
  +-- PostgreSQL on Supabase (RLS on, Data API roles revoked)
  +-- Supabase Storage (private audio cache, signed URLs)
  +-- AI generation services (Gemini by default)
  +-- Kokoro TTS, reached through a tunnel, with browser fallback
  +-- Review and study scheduling services
```

### Key Design Decisions

- The browser only talks to our API. Supabase's public Data API is closed on every table (row level security with no policies plus revoked grants), so a leaked publishable key reads nothing.
- Runtime backend state: the frontend can still discover a backend URL at runtime, which is what the local and tunnel setups use.
- Safe connection fallback: read-only API calls can recover from stale saved backend URLs by refreshing the global runtime backend state.
- Token plus cookie auth: cookies support same-site local flows, while bearer tokens support cross-domain mobile usage.
- Validated AI writes: generated lessons, questions, topics, and flashcards are checked before being persisted so invalid or partial AI output does not corrupt study state.
- Bootstrap before serving: the backend validates and upgrades legacy database schemas before accepting traffic.

## Running Locally

### Fast Path on Windows

From the repository root:

```powershell
.\start-project.cmd
```

To start backend, frontend, and Cloudflare Tunnel together:

```powershell
.\start-project.cmd -WithTunnel
```

For the deployed Vercel frontend plus local backend flow, use:

```powershell
.\ativar-tudo.cmd
```

That script starts FastAPI, opens a Cloudflare Tunnel, and publishes the current backend URL so the Vercel frontend can find it.
The Windows launchers also ensure the local PostgreSQL container is running before the API starts.

### Backend Manually

```powershell
cd apps/api
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python database_bootstrap.py
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```

Backend health check:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest http://127.0.0.1:8001/health
```

### Frontend Manually

```powershell
cd apps/web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Local URLs:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8001
- PostgreSQL: `127.0.0.1:5433` (keeps the default `5432` free for other local projects)

### Local PostgreSQL

This project uses a dedicated local PostgreSQL instance on host port `5433`.
That avoids collisions with another PostgreSQL server that may already be
running on the default `5432` port.

```powershell
docker compose up db -d
python scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py --postgres-url "postgresql://kids_tutor:kids_tutor_secret@127.0.0.1:5433/kids_tutor"
```

The migration script backs up `apps/api/kids_tutor.sqlite`, migrates from a
working copy, refuses to copy into a non-empty PostgreSQL database by default,
and verifies row counts before reporting success.

## Runtime Backend Connection

The deployed frontend needs a reachable backend URL. There are two supported paths:

1. Automatic: run `.\ativar-tudo.cmd`, which publishes the current tunnel URL.
2. Manual: open `/connect` in the deployed frontend and paste the Cloudflare Tunnel URL.

Example:

```text
https://tutorprofessor.vercel.app/connect
```

The app stores the backend URL per browser and can also read a shared runtime state from the Vercel API. This avoids redeploying the frontend every time a temporary Cloudflare URL changes.

## Environment Variables

### Backend

Create `apps/api/.env` or use the local secret flow documented in `local.secrets.example`.

```env
APP_HOST=0.0.0.0
APP_PORT=8001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://kids_tutor:kids_tutor_secret@127.0.0.1:5433/kids_tutor
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://tutorprofessor.vercel.app,https://english-tutor-kid.vercel.app
SESSION_SECRET=change-me

GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.1-flash-lite

TTS_PROVIDER=kokoro
KOKORO_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8880/v1/audio/speech

PARENT_COOKIE_SECURE=true
PARENT_COOKIE_SAMESITE=none

# The single administrator: the account with this e-mail owns /admin and never
# waits in its own approval queue. ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH is an optional recovery
# password so the administrator can sign in even if the stored one is lost.
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=

# Brute-force brake on login. Defaults shown; the lock clears itself.
MAX_FAILED_LOGINS=5
LOGIN_LOCK_MINUTES=15
```

### Creating the Administrator Account

`ADMIN_EMAIL` names the administrator, but the account itself still has to exist
in the database. Create it (or reset its password) with:

```bash
python scripts/create-admin-user.py --email admin@yourdomain.com
```

The script prints the `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` line to store in the environment.
Then sign in at `/login` with that e-mail and open `/admin`.

### Frontend

For local development:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001
```

For the deployed flow, the runtime backend route can resolve the tunnel URL dynamically.

## Testing and Verification

Useful checks:

```powershell
cd apps/web
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
```

```powershell
python scripts/test_language_ai_questions.py
python scripts/test_programming_ai_flashcards.py
python scripts/test_ai_flashcard_service.py
python scripts/test_admin_account_approval.py
python scripts/test_ai_credits.py
python scripts/test_password_security.py
python scripts/test_tenant_isolation.py
python scripts/test_account_modules.py
python scripts/test_account_self_service.py
python scripts/test_billing_and_usage.py
```

`test_tenant_isolation.py` is the one to run after touching any route. Besides
driving two accounts against each other over HTTP, it audits every registered
route: a data route that does not resolve its tenant through a known helper, or
an `/api/admin` route that never reaches an admin check, turns it red. Adding an
endpoint that answers with whatever id it was handed fails the build instead of
shipping quietly.

```powershell
node apps/web/scripts/test-api-offline-fallback.mjs
node apps/web/scripts/test-pwa-manifest-and-sw.mjs
node apps/web/scripts/test-runtime-backend-state.mjs
node apps/web/scripts/test-lesson-question-state.mjs
node apps/web/scripts/test-diverse-question-state.mjs
```

The test suite is a mix of service-level tests, API behavior checks, and lightweight frontend state tests. It focuses on high-risk areas: AI output validation, concurrent/stale generation flows, runtime backend selection, and review state consistency.

## Engineering Highlights

- Runtime backend freshness: the app chooses the newest backend state when multiple storage sources disagree.
- Stale tunnel recovery: safe read-only frontend requests can retry against the latest global backend URL.
- Cross-domain auth support: token auth complements cookies for Vercel-to-tunnel and mobile browser scenarios.
- AI validation before persistence: generated batches are checked for count, identity, ownership, and schema before database writes.
- Atomic generation paths: invalid AI output should fail without partial database rows.
- Local database resilience: startup bootstrap handles legacy local schemas before serving requests.
- Honest UX states: loading, empty, offline, retry, and recovery states are part of the product flow.

## Trade-offs and Current Limitations

- Vercel does not run migrations. Run `database_bootstrap.py` against the Supabase session pooler before pushing code that needs a new one.
- Google sign-in is broken across the two `.vercel.app` domains (the callback cookie lands on the API's domain); e-mail login is unaffected. A custom domain or a one-time code on the redirect fixes it.
- Only the Kokoro voice may still depend on a local machine and a tunnel; when it is unreachable the app uses browser speech.
- Some tests are script-based rather than a single unified test runner.
- No payment gateway is wired in. Plans, limits, trials, usage and the webhook all work; what is missing is the checkout call in `start_checkout` and the credentials.
- Rate limiting counts in process memory, so the effective ceiling multiplies by the number of uvicorn workers. Fine for one worker, which is the current deployment; move it to a shared store before scaling out.
- The per-generation AI cost is an estimate until the provider layer reports token counts.
- `apps/api/main.py` is one large module. The route audit in `scripts/test_tenant_isolation.py` keeps the security properties honest, but splitting it into routers is still owed.
- The app has grown beyond the original English-only scope into a broader personal tutor, so naming and documentation are being updated accordingly.

## Suggested Interview Walkthrough

If you are reviewing the project, start here:

1. Open the live frontend and note the local-backend requirement.
2. Read `apps/web/src/lib/api-config.ts` and `apps/web/src/lib/runtime-backend.ts` for runtime backend resolution.
3. Read `apps/api/main.py` around auth, lessons, review, and AI generation routes.
4. Inspect service modules under `apps/api/services/` for validation and domain logic.
5. Run `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` and one or two scripts under `scripts/` or `apps/web/scripts/`.
